# My Monster Game

Concept
  - You play as the monster. Coins are "packages" you need to collect and deliver to the door. 
  - Robots act as patrolling obstacles that try to catch you. 
  - The goal is to gather coins and reach the door without getting caught.
  - The game is in principle open-ended but I wil become unplayable I fear once a certain amount of robots are added to the mix. 

Features:
  - Arcade-like 2D game using the pygame package (requires to install pygame using `pip3 install pygame`)
  - Procedural level generation (number of coins, robots, robot speed increases with level)
  - Real-time enemy pathfinding: the robots try to follow the shortest way to the monster. 

This was the final project in an advanced python programming course I took a while back. 

I think there is still a lot of room for improvement / better structuring. Suggestions welcome. :)
